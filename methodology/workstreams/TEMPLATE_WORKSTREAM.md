# [Domain Name] Workstream

Adaptation of the [Iterative Session Methodology](../ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md) for [describe the type of work].

---

## When to Use

Use this workstream when:
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]
- [Condition 3]

---

## Phase 2: Research ([Domain]-Specific)

### Step 1: Study the [Requirements/Domain/Problem]

[What to read, extract, and understand before anything else.]

Key questions:
- [Domain-specific question 1]
- [Domain-specific question 2]
- [Domain-specific question 3]

### Step 2: Inventory [Components/Systems/Materials]

Map what you're working with:

| Item | [Column 2] | [Column 3] | [Column 4] |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

### Step 3: Read [Implementations/Contracts/Specs]

[What to read beyond the surface level. What does "reading the implementation" mean in this domain?]

### Step 4: Review Prior Work

[How to find and use previous session outputs in this domain.]

### Step 5: Challenge Scope

[Domain-specific scope validation questions.]

### Step 6: Validate [Domain Fit / Technology Choice / Tool Selection]

[Domain-specific validation of whether you're using the right approach.]

### Step 7: Verify Assumptions

[What critical assumptions exist in this domain, and how to verify them.]

---

## Phase 3: Create ([Domain]-Specific)

### The Deliverable

[What does the Phase 3 output look like for this domain? Document structure, diagram format, plan template, etc.]

### Key Design Decisions

[What are the most important decisions in this domain? What makes a good design vs. a bad one?]

## Scope Validation Questions ([Domain]-Specific)

1. [Question]
2. [Question]
3. [Question]
4. [Question]
5. [Question]

## Verification Checklist ([Domain]-Specific)

Before presenting:

- [ ] [Check 1]
- [ ] [Check 2]
- [ ] [Check 3]
- [ ] [Check 4]
- [ ] [Check 5]

## Reference Table Formats ([Domain])

### [Table Name]
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|

---

## Common Anti-Patterns ([Domain])

1. **[Name]** — [Description of the mistake and why it happens.]
2. **[Name]** — [Description.]
3. **[Name]** — [Description.]

## Example Session Outline

```
Session N: [Work Item Name]

Pre-Flight: [What was checked]
Research:   [What was examined]
Create:     [What was designed]
Present:    [Approval result]
Implement:  [What was changed]
Close:      [Metrics and learnings]
```
